Trivia Game For IDC course in BGU.
The main idea is to create a working TCP connection between server and clients.
The server sends questions to the clients (as many as you want) and the clients have 10 seconds to answer them
if they answer wrongly or they are not able to answer in 10 seconds, they will receive another question until 1 player answers correctly.
when the game is ended once either of clients declared the winner, the connection is closed between the server and the clients, and restarts to search clients.
same for the clients, once the game is over , they restart and search for server to connect to.
